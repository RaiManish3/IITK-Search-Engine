# IITK-Search-Engine
To say in brief it searchs page and people within IITK when provided a key to look for.<br>

# Where does the program sucks
Although the program is not the final one, and still under development.<br>
We are currently facing speed issues with the retrieval of result.<br>
Implementing database can be one solution to speed up the process to some extent.<br>
Another is that there is no web front end to it.<br>

# Running the program
In terminal, run "python3 webcrawler".<br>
